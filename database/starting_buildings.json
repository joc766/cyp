The building, Collegiate Gothic with modernistic Arts & Craft and Art Nouveau touches, is of brick and seam-faced granite with limestone trim.  James Gamble Rogers was the architect. The use of various interconnected low buildings, grouped around two courts with a central fourteen-story tower was characteristic of Rogers conscious effort to create urban compositions. The Hall was designed to be self-contained.  It includes dormitory accommodations for students, faculty apartments, and classrooms, lecture halls, faculty offices, dining hall and common rooms. The office of the Provost is also located here.. In 1993 accessibility ramps were built at the main entrance, and in 1997, the McDougal  --                                                                           .
